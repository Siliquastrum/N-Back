## What is n-Back
The N-back task is a continuous performance task used in cognitive neuroscience to assess a part of working memory. The task involves remembering a sequence of stimuli presented one by one and indicating when the current stimulus matches the one from N steps earlier in the sequence.

## Here's how it works:
1-back task: Participants must remember the stimulus from one step back.\
2-back task: Participants must remember the stimulus from two steps back.\
3-back task: Participants must remember the stimulus from three steps back, and so on.\
For example, if the sequence is Black, Red, Black, Blue, Black and you're doing a 2-back task:

The third Black matches the Black that was presented two steps back.\
The second Red does not match anything from two steps back.\
The fourth Black matches the Black that was two steps back.\
The N-back task is commonly used in research to study working memory capacity and executive control.
There are also studies showing that n-back tasks improve working memory and eventually it increase IQ!
